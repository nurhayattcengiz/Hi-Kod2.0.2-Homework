# Donguler (Loops)

This folder contains Python mini-projects based on loop structures (`while` and `for`). Each project solves a specific exercise commonly given to beginners and is designed for clarity, logic, and user interaction.

# Contents

1. **vergi_hesaplama.py**  
   Calculates tax based on salary input with `if-elif-else` statements.

2. **sifre_uzunluk_kontrol.py**  
   Verifies password length is at least 6 characters using `if` condition.

3. **sifre_aralik_kontrol.py**  
   Ensures password length is between 5 and 10 characters using a `while` loop.

4. **sifre_dogrulama_deneme.py**  
   Prompts the user for password up to 3 times with a preset correct password using `while` loop and `break`.

# Key Concepts

- `while` loops for validation and retries  
- `if-elif-else` logic for multi-tier decision-making  
- Input validation  
- User feedback and condition-based flow
