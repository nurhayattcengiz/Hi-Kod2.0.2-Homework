NumPy Array Practice
This project demonstrates how to create and manipulate arrays using NumPy. It covers one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional arrays with indexing, slicing, and merging operations.

- Create arrays with specific data types (e.g., integers)
- Access array properties: shape, size, dimensions
- Indexing to retrieve specific elements
- Slicing to extract sub-arrays
- Merge arrays vertically and horizontally
